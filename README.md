# war-pigs
War Pigs is a Java-based Battleship clone written in early 2007 as part of a training program at an old job. It uses Swing to create the UI and showcases some basic (albeit useful) concepts such as buffered graphics, event listeners, etc.

I did **NOT** create and do **NOT** own the rights to the graphics used in this project. 

This game is provided on github solely for educational purposes or for any old co-workers of mine who may stumble on this and are feeling nostalgic. :o)

As this project is from over 13 years ago and hasn't really been touched since then, I take no responsibility for the level of chaos or confusion you might find within.
